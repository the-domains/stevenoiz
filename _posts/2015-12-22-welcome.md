He flew to NYC and got a job as a Film Producer for the Spark Group company in mid town Manhattan.

As he progressed he's gotten better as a Visual Artist, he has a great eye for composition, he's always looking to spark his imagination, see things from different perspectives to work his way around the job and keep trying new creative ideas for every video he does. Always self-motivated to work on new videos and pushing his limits to create the best out of it.
