# My name is Stevenson Grullon

I'm a an upcoming filmmaker and producer based in Brooklyn. I do motion videos, aerial cinematography, time-lapse photography, art design, portrait and nature photography as well. I started working in audio production on radio stations such as Super Q FM as a Programing Director for a show called Plus Hours on the weekends in Dominican Republic. Later on I started making short little videos for their website. As I kept progressing on video work I decided to go to Full Sail University in Orlando, Fl to follow my career, which is being a Filmmaker. I made all kinds of video work like short skits, short films, music videos, behind the scenes and small family events back in the day as part of the camera team in multiple productions. ![](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/defccb4d7288f7223ae86a17f791f071/passthrough.png?height=497&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5cfceee4-f761-4c07-a5da-1f6145bb8903.png&width=750)

## Telling Stories One Frame at a Time

As I progressed I've been learning and growing my knowledge in cinematography, as a Visual Artist, I got a great eye for composition and lighting but that doesn't stop me to always look to spark his imagination, see things from different perspectives to work my way around the job and keep trying new creative ideas for every shoot I do. Always self-motivated to work on new videos and pushing my limits to create the best out of it. 

''I believe storytelling is the most powerful way to throw ideas into the world we live in today.'' 

You can find me in any of these!
